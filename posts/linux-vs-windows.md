# Windows or Linux?

Based on my [Github post](https://github.com/AnAncientForce/dotfiles)

While they're both amazing operating systems, they have their differences. I choose Linux over Windows 10 because:

- Linux is Open Source (I like to know I'm in safe hands and not in the dark)
- Linux is a UNIX-like operating system which is my preferred choice. It feels more natural to use. Terminals are the most important!
- Customization: It's endless! I can make my system function and look exactly how I like (which is a big thing to me)
- I genuinely like Window Managers more then desktops (I'm using Hyprland). They are more functional and easier to use. Having two windows snap by side by default and full screen while only one window is open is just perfect.
- Package Managers are just a life saver! Incredibly easy to install applications!
- I like how Linux is community driven with so much choice and is not owned by a single company which is closed source (Microsoft)
  Linux uses significantly less ram then Windows does by default (depending on the setup)

### So, what about gaming?

- Why do I use Windows 10 for games? Because of anticheat: It is not available on Linux.
  Xorg vs Wayland, my experience? This is hard because so many things work on Xorg and are easier. However, Wayland eliminates screen tearing and is extremely smooth! Ultimately, I chose Wayland because it's still actively worked on and because Hyprland is so smooth! :-)
